* module names in PURSuit should link to their GH repos
* Data.Array.transpose?
* type errors:
    should tell the particular expression type checking failed at.
    should use comprehensible type names
* mconcat for monoid? (answer: it's in foldable)
* fmap is only (<$>)
* documentation is a bit scattered
* Why does typing Debug.Tr<tab> expand to Debug.Trace.print when there is at
  least Debug.Trace.trace? And why does Debug.Trace.t<tab> not work?
* :i should only expand to module names, not value names
* dotPsci in the leanpub book didn't work; no errors reported, but empty .psci
  file. Fixed by having srcFiles as an actual JS variable.
* Ability to use PSCI if compilation fails, like GHCi + cabal does. External
  libraries may be used, but not code in your own project that failed to
  compile.
* psci doesn't seem to autocomplete data contructors
